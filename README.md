Projects in Course: 20595-Information(Data) Mining, Semester: 2022 b.
 
 
This is repo of my works as part of the Information Mining course at the Open University of Israel.

The first work is mmn21 and it focuses on data preprocessing and the use of classification and prediction methods for the "obesity problem".

The second work is mmn22 (still in process) and like the first one is about the "obesity problem" but I will use the context rules and cluster analysis.
